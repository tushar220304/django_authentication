Hi

In this Django i have created the following things-
  Login 
  Logout
  Change Password
  Reset/Forogt password using link send in mail id
  
  
User cannot visit some page with out login and after login it will automatically redirected to that page.
Some static files may not work but it can be fixed
  

Go to this link https://internAssignment.pythonanywhere.com/account/login/ you can check the hosted site

I attached the postgres db in elephant sql but the db connection code was commented in settings.py file because python anywhere not support postgresql in free plan so thats why i have used the db sqlite3

so i advised you to clone this repository in your local machine by running the running the following command - git clone https://github.com/tushar220304/django_authentication.git

then install the requirements file by running - pip install -r requirements.txt

and the last things uncomment the postgress db code from settings.py file and save it.

It will automatically connect to the postgres db

now simply run the server by - python manage.py runserver
